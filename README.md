# school_district_analysis

## Overview of Project
Overview of school district's key metrics, in term of school type, budget, spending summary per capita vs studentâ€™s academic performance. 

## Purpose
Provide high-level snapshot summary of student's performance, to discover trends and correlation amongst key metrics.

## Top 5 Schools Before & After Data Exlcusion 

***Top 5 Schools:***

***Top 5 Schools with NaN Data Exclusion:***
![Top 5 school with NaN](https://github.com/aimeeyen/school_district_analysis/blob/main/Top%20Performaning%20with%20Data%20Exculsion%20.png)
 - Top 5 school ranking stayed the same, with small fraciton 0.05~ variance: 
   ***lower*** math average score
   ***higher*** reading average score
 - % overall passing, % passing math and % passing reading ***lowered***

## District Summary Before vs After Data Exclusion

***District Summary:***

***With NaN Data Exclusion:***

 - At high-level summary view, there's only ***slight variance*** after the data exlcusion, would be much more variance if summary were compared at 9th grade level alone.  
 
***School Type:***

# Results


   - :x: Winter season: Dec - Feb is the ***worst*** time to launch campaign and in Jan has the ***highest*** canceled campaigns

   - Both Failed and Successful campaign have positive correlations, signify that both variables were affected equally by the timing of launch date, seasonality: such as School break or Holiday season. 


### - What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
   - :white_check_mark: :heavy_dollar_sign: Goal less than $5000 and between $35K to $44.9K shown the ***highest*** success rate
   - :x: :heavy_dollar_sign: Goal between $45K and above have the ***lowest*** success rate



### - What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
   - Chart of total duration (days) of Successful and Failed campaign vs launch date. Also it will be insightful visualization to draw 

## Summary:
 - :x: :heavy_dollar_sign: Goal between $45K and above have the ***lowest*** success rate
 - :x: :heavy_dollar_sign: Goal between $45K and above have the ***lowest*** success rate
 - :x: :heavy_dollar_sign: Goal between $45K and above have the ***lowest*** success rate
 - :x: :heavy_dollar_sign: Goal between $45K and above have the ***lowest*** success rate
