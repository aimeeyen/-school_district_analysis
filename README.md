 - Top 5 school ranking stayed the same, with small fraciton 0.05~ variance: 
   lower math average score
   higher reading average score
 - % overall passing, % passing math and reading ***lowered***

### District Summary before vs after data exclusion

 - Sucess rate tends to decreased as the fundraising goal inceases, hense a negative correlation 
 - At $15K, $35K and $44K have the equal percentage at around 50%.
 - After $45K goal, a steep decline of success rate
 - Between $35K to $45K, seemed to be the most stable performating goal setting.

# Results

### - What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?


   - :white_check_mark: Summer season: May and June is the ***best*** time to launch campaign

   - :x: Winter season: Dec - Feb is the ***worst*** time to launch campaign and in Jan has the ***highest*** canceled campaigns

   - Both Failed and Successful campaign have positive correlations, signify that both variables were affected equally by the timing of launch date, seasonality: such as School break or Holiday season. 


### - What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
   - :white_check_mark: :heavy_dollar_sign: Goal less than $5000 and between $35K to $44.9K shown the ***highest*** success rate
   - :x: :heavy_dollar_sign: Goal between $45K and above have the ***lowest*** success rate



### - What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
   - Chart of total duration (days) of Successful and Failed campaign vs launch date. Also it will be insightful visualization to draw 

## Summary:
 - :x: :heavy_dollar_sign: Goal between $45K and above have the ***lowest*** success rate
 - :x: :heavy_dollar_sign: Goal between $45K and above have the ***lowest*** success rate
 - :x: :heavy_dollar_sign: Goal between $45K and above have the ***lowest*** success rate
 - :x: :heavy_dollar_sign: Goal between $45K and above have the ***lowest*** success rate
