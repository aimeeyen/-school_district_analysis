# school_district_analysis

## Overview of Project
Overview of school district's key metrics, in term of school type, budget, spending summary per capita vs studentâ€™s academic performance. 

## Purpose
Provide high-level snapshot summary of student's performance, to discover trends and correlation amongst key metrics.

## Top 5 Schools Before & After Data Exlcusion 

***Top 5 Schools:***

***Top 5 Schools with NaN Data Exclusion:***

 - Top 5 school ranking stayed the same, with small fraciton 0.05~ variance: 
   ***lower*** math average score
   ***higher*** reading average score
 - % overall passing, % passing math and % passing reading ***lowered***

## District Summary Before vs After Data Exclusion

***District Summary:***

***With NaN Data Exclusion:***
![District Summary After Data](https://github.com/aimeeyen/school_district_analysis/blob/main/District%20Summary%20with%20Data%20Exclusion.png)
- At high-level summary view, there's only ***slight variance*** after the data exlcusion, would be much more variance if summary were compared at 9th grade level alone.  
 
## School Type Before vs After Data Exclusion 

***School Type:***

***School Type with NaN Data Exculsion:***
![School Type with NaN](https://github.com/aimeeyen/school_district_analysis/blob/main/School%20Type%20After%20Data%20Exclusion.png)

- ONLY a small .01 variance with data exclusion on % Passing Math, however % overall passing and % passing reading there's 0.04 variance, lowered than compared to pre-data exclsuion. 


# Results
With data exlucsion for 9th grade at Thomas High School:
   - there's only slighest variance changes, lowered the % passing for math and reading on overall grade level. 
   - School size, spending and type did not change with data exclusion
   - However average math and reading score ***increased***.
