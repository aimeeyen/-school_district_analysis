# school_district_analysis

## Overview of Project
Overview of school district's key metrics, in term of school type, budget, spending summary per capita vs studentâ€™s academic performance. 

### Purpose
Provide high-level snapshot summary of student's performance, to discover trends and correlation amongst key metrics.

## Analysis and Challenges


Thomas High Shcool: 
Prior on replacing data: 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

 - Highest performning month: May (Memorial and Mother's day) Also Feburary (Valentine)
 - Decline in success rate during School break: Spring, Summer, and Winter Break
 - Deline in success rate during Holiday season: 4th of July, Thanksgiving and Christmas
 - Low performing month Nov-Dec, maybe signifiy lower purchasing power during Holiday seasons
 - The two variances Failed and Successful Outcomes, are in positive correlation. 

### District Summary before vs after data exclusion

![District Summary](https://github.com/aimeeyen/school_district_analysis/blob/main/District%20Summary.png)
 - Sucess rate tends to decreased as the fundraising goal inceases, hense a negative correlation 
 - At $15K, $35K and $44K have the equal percentage at around 50%.
 - After $45K goal, a steep decline of success rate
 - Between $35K to $45K, seemed to be the most stable performating goal setting.  
 

# Results

### - What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?


   - :white_check_mark: Summer season: May and June is the ***best*** time to launch campaign

   - :x: Winter season: Dec - Feb is the ***worst*** time to launch campaign and in Jan has the ***highest*** canceled campaigns

   - Both Failed and Successful campaign have positive correlations, signify that both variables were affected equally by the timing of launch date, seasonality: such as School break or Holiday season. 


### - What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

   
   - :white_check_mark: :heavy_dollar_sign: Goal less than $5000 and between $35K to $44.9K shown the ***highest*** success rate


   - :x: :heavy_dollar_sign: Goal between $45K and above have the ***lowest*** success rate




### - What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
   - Chart of total duration (days) of Successful and Failed campaign vs launch date. Also it will be insightful visualization to draw 

## Conclusion:
